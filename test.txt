['Table 1. The detailed aging treatment procedures.', 'The grain boundaries of specimens under cases 1 -3a r e smooth and straight, as shown in Figure 2a and c. The grain boundaries parallel to the external stress are easy to slide, while the grain boundaries perpendicular to the external stress tend to crack. Generally, the grain boundaries are relatively weak at high temperatures.$^{[62]}$Because the diffusion rate of atoms along grain boundaries is accelerated, the resistance of grain boundaries to deformation is greatly weakened at high temperatures. In addition, the grain is strengthened due to dispersive precipitation of γ 00 and γ 0 strengthening phases in the transgranular. So, the grain boundary sliding easily occurs when the long-term external stress is applied. For cases 1 -3, the alloys have fewer δ phases at grain boundaries, and the grain boundaries sliding can easily start once the boundaries get loosen in the later creep stage. So, the elongation to fracture of cases 1 -3 are lower than 2%, as shown in Figure 5b. Also, it can be observed that the length and width of cracks are gradually reduced with the increase of aging time from 0 h (case 1) to 4 h (case 3). As the aging time is 8 h, the pinning effects of δ phase can strongly relieve, even prevent the sliding of specificgrain boundary. Meanwhile, the strengthen element (Nb) in γ 00 phase near the grain boundary is consumed, resulting in the formation of a plastic deformation zone. Therefore, the elongation to fracture of case 4 can reaches 11%, and the failure mode of case 4 is a ductile intergranular fracture. This is in consistent with the previous research of Rao et al. [65] and W. Chen et al. [66] That is, to say, reasonable initial δ phase at the grain boundaries can hinder grain boundary sliding and enhance elongation to fracture. When the aging time is 16 h, the formation of a large number of needle-shape δ phases can weaken the bonding strength of grain boundaries, which accelerates the initiation and expansion of cracks at grain boundaries. [64] Therefore, excessive initial δ phases can weaken the creep resistance of the aged superalloy, and accelerate the failure process.', 'As shown in Figure 2a (case 1), fine equiaxed grains, clean grain boundaries and annealing twins can be observed. From Figure 2a -c, a small amount of δ phases precipitate at grain boundaries when the aging time is not over 4 h. This is because that δ phase preferentially nucleates at the twin boundaries and grain boundaries in the aging process. For case 4, two kinds of morphologies (short rod-like and spherical) of δ phases can be found, as illustrated in Figure 2d. The short rod-like δ phases are mainly distributed at twin boundaries and grain boundaries, and merely a handful of spherical δ phases appear in grains. When the superalloy is aged at 900 $^{GLYPH<C14>}$C for 16 h (case 5), the volume fraction of δ phases significantly increases. Meanwhile, Figure 2e indicates that a great deal of long needle-like δ phases precipitate from the matrix. [11,12] The volume fraction of initial δ phases can be statistically calculated by quantitative metallographic techniques on Image-Pro plus 6.0 software. [59] ImagePro plus 6.0 software is usually used by international researchers. [60] For ensuring the measurement precision, eight different metallographic pictures are taken from different samples for each aging condition. [61] Then, the average contents of initial δ phases are statistically measured as 1.62%, 2.56%, 4.56%, and 10.8% for cases 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Additionally, for case 1, there is almost no δ phase in the matrix. Obviously, the aging time has significantly impacts on the volume fraction of initial δ phase. In general, the precipitation process of δ phase can be regarded as diffusioncontrolled. The long aging time can provide the enough energy and duration for the nucleation and growth of δ phase. Therefore, with the increased aging time, the volume fraction of initial δ phase increases, and its distribution becomes uniform.', 'The uniaxial creep experiments were conducted on MTSGWT2015 test machine at the temperature of 670 $^{GLYPH<C14>}$C and applied stress of 700 MPa. Before the creep tests, the samples were first heated to the tested temperature, and kept for 20 min to ensure the homogeneous temperature distribution. The creep temperature in the whole test process was monitored through two K -type thermocouples placed in the gage location. The creep strain was measured through the averaging extensometer system of MTS-GWT2015. For each aged superalloy, five creep', 'In order to analyze the fracture behaviors and fracture mechanisms, the fracture surfaces of the creep-ruptured specimens are observed by SEM. The fractographs of specimens with different initial δ phase amount are depicted in Figure 7 . Figure 7a and b (case 1) shows the clear-cut and smooth fracture characteristics, which are the typical rock candy block morphology. Also, it can be seen that the long and large wedge cracks propagate along the grain boundaries. So, the failure mode is a typical intergranular fracture. This result is in consistent with the previous report. [61] The failure modes of case 2 (Figure 7c, d) and case 3 (Figure 7e,f) are similar to that of case 1. The main difference between these cases is that the wedge cracks become smaller and smaller with the increased aging time at 900 $^{GLYPH<C14>}$C. But, the fractographs of case 4 are greatly']
